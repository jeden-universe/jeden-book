# The Jeden Book

Welcome to the realm of Jeden. This realm lives at the intersection of the worlds of practical computing and foundations of mathematics. These two worlds are connected by a formal equivalence between programming and logic, often referred to as the “Curry-Howard equivalence.” Computer programs are equivalent to mathematical proofs.

This book displays multiple personalities. Some sections read like a tutorial programming book. Other sections contain formal mathematical theorems that may be difficult to understand by the uninitiated. Every section, except this informal introductory chapter, is marked either as:

<dl>
<dt>informal</dt>
<dd>A reader familiar with computer programming grasps all the general concepts. Some sections may require some experimentation with examples or further reading on less familiar technical concepts.</dd>
<dt>tutorial</dt>
<dd>A novice of functional programming languages will need a lot of practice and patience to master the Jeden language.</dd>
<dt>normative</dt>
<dd>The section is intended as a binding specification that a software tool should satisfy. It is mostly written in a technical language.</dd>
<dt>
<dt>formal</dt>
<dd>The section is written in the style of mathematical literature and contains formal proofs. The reader is assumed to have an important mathematical vocabulary.</dd>
</dl>

If you find that some sections do not fulfill this contract, please send feedback!

## What is Jeden?

“Jeden” is the Polish word for the number one. The language's name is a reference to the principle of Univalence. Univalence is the mathematical axiom stating that equality is equivalent to an equivalence. The statement may seem odd on a first reading, but will become familiar after studying it from multiple angles. From a programmer's perspective, univalence provides safe coercion between equivalent types and a useful framework for automatic code generation. From a mathematician's perspective, univalence is a powerful proof tool. The Jeden computer language is an attempt to unify these perspectives into one.
